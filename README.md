# ngx-Dumblog

The new version of [Dumblog](https://github.com/pedroCX486/dumblog), now fully written in Angular! Still in development, design decisions may change. Not ready for production use.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Contributing

Just do a pull request.  :-)
