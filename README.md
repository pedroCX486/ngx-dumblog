# ngx-Dumblog

The new version of [Dumblog](https://github.com/pedroCX486/dumblog), now fully written in Angular! This version brings a fresh new code to the table. I always thought that the idea of having a local editor was neat, but not really usable for Linux/Mac users (especially me, that have an Linux machine too). So now you have an full-fledged editor online (just for editing, it can't save the files to your repo), customization on the configs.json and a few things more.

## Running locally

First run `npm install` then run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build --prod` to build it.

## Contributing

Just do a pull request.  :-)

## Why?

Because I always thought Jekyll to be too convoluted and I wanted something dumb and simple. The code isn't an example of awesomeness but it does the job and pretty well at that. Way better than the bullshit that was the old version in JQuery and C#.
