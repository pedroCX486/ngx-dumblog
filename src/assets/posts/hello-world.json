Maybe IE would let you do it.<br>- In the configs.json file you will find some settings like the 'About' modal text, blog name and how many posts to load on the home page.<br>- There's also the default favicon, which you can change.<br>- Included in .github.io/editor is the editor called Canvas, based on the CK Editor.<br>- To publish to GitHub Pages you just need to commit to your .github.io repo the files generated in the /dist folder of the Dumblog repo. They come ready to publish.<br>- You don't need to rebuild anything with Angular. Just modify the configs.json and go forth!<br><br>And I guess that's it! Happy blogging!</p>"
