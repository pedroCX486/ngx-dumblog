Maybe IE would let you do it.<br>- In the configs.json file you will find some settings like the 'About' text, blog name and how many posts dumblog should load on the home page.<br>- There's also the default favicon, which you can change.<br>- Included in .github.io/?page=editor is the editor called Canvas, based on the CK Editor.<br>- To publish on GitHub Pages you just need to commit to your .github.io repo the files generated in the /dist folder after you run <i><strong>npm install</strong> </i>and then <i><strong>npm run build</strong></i> on your console. (There's also pre-compiled files on the repo.)<br>- If you use the pre-compiled version, you don't need to (re)build anything. Just modify the configs.json and publish it! The pre-compiled version is generated using <i><strong>npm run build</strong></i>.<br><br>And I guess that's it! Happy blogging!</p>",
