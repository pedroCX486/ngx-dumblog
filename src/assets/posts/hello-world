Maybe IE would let you do it.<br>- In the configs.json file you will find some settings like the 'About' modal text and the blog name.<br>- There's also the default favicon, which you can change.<br>- Included in the /posts/editor folder is in the source and compiled version of Dumblog Canvas, an simple editor used to create posts for Dumblog. (Beware! The code is horrendous!)<br>- To publish to .github.io you'll also need to add a .GITIGNORE containing the following text: [Ee]ditor/<br>- You can use HTML in the editor, just don't use < br > tags, because the code already parses linebreaks (generated by enter key) as a linebreak.<br>- If you want to change the default post to another instead of this one, you'll need to point to it on the archive.lst (same applies if you want to delete an entry in the archive)<br><br>And I guess that's it! Happy blogging!"
